- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Geometric figures with CSS

### What I learned

How to make a triangle with CSS:
```html
<div class="arrow-up"></div>
```
```css
.arrow-up {
    position: absolute;
    width: 0; 
    height: 0; 
    border-left: 20px solid transparent;
    border-right: 20px solid transparent;
    border-bottom: 20px solid white;
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    bottom: -8px;
    right: -13px;
  }
```
### Continued development

Next projects to use Vite and Tailwindcss.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Triangle](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) - The idea is a box with zero width and height. The actual width and height of the arrow is determined by the width of the border. In an up arrow, for example, the bottom border is colored while the left and right are transparent, which forms the triangle.
